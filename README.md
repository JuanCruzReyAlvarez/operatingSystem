Through the completion of this work, it is expected to: Acquire practical concepts of the use of the different programming tools and interfaces (APIs) provided by 
operating systems. Understand aspects of the design of an operating system. Affirm various theoretical concepts of the subject through the practical implementation 
of some of them. Become familiar with system programming techniques, such as the use of makefiles, configuration files, and log files. Learn in detail the operation 
of Linux through the use of a relatively low-level programming language such as C. Serialization and deserialization of data. Traffic lights. Threads. Deployment and 
Testing of the Work. Etc, among many more concepts. The work consists of 4 modules: Console: 10%, Kernel: 30%, CPU: 30%, Memory+SWAP: 30%.
